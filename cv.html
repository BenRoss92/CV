<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<h4 id="communication-proactivity">Communication &amp; Proactivity</h4>
<p>At TIG and MN2S, I voluntarily created tutorials and notes which would help train future interns quicker. At Makers Academy, I lead a retrospective for a cohort of 25 people and was praised for being engaging, leading discussions and prompting important questions. I also mentored a junior student, providing clear and patient instruction. When planning <a href="https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2">Plyr2</a> as a group, I encouraged open discussions and democratic decisions to promote strong teamwork.</p>
<h4 id="learning-technical-skills">Learning Technical Skills</h4>
<p>In order to redesign both the <a href="http://louisparkinsonclimbing.co.uk/">Louis Parkinson Climbing</a> and <a href="http://manoverboardswing.co.uk/">Man Overboard Quintet</a> websites, I taught myself HTML, CSS and improved my WordPress knowledge, as well as Google Analytics and social media analytics tools to market Louis Parkinson Climbing. At MN2S, I learnt WordPress and basic Photoshop quickly, researching anything unfamiliar and keeping notes to recall steps quickly and avoid repeating questions, as well as learning affiliate marketing programs at Stream:20.</p>
<h4 id="researching-solving-problems">Researching &amp; Solving Problems</h4>
<p>As a Technical Support Intern, I researched and solved customers’ bugs without previous IT experience, deducing where and how to look. I pitched two prototype ideas at Makers Academy - <a href="https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro">Atomodoro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2">Plyr2</a> - subsequently voted by my cohort of twenty-five people into becoming real projects. At The Angel Inn, I improved the efficiency of managing reservations by providing a visual solution to management.</p>
<h4 id="analytical-thinking">Analytical Thinking</h4>
<p>At JW3, I created a hot-desking plan to accommodate staff within limited space. I calculated the remaining desk time available by subtracting the total hours worked from the total available desk time. I then assigned working hours by viewing the daily total differences in a table. I also helped the CEO gain an overview of important staff and customer feedback by tallying, ranking and combining varying and unstructured answers into tables and graphs for concise reporting.</p>
