<hr />
<p>I’m a creative full stack developer with a background in music. I discovered a passion for coding while teaching myself front-end development in my spare time and decided to pursue it as a career by studying full-stack development at Makers Academy, London's leading coding boot camp. Since then I have quickly adapted to working in small and larger teams with new and older codebases using a variety of technologies.</p>
