## Skills

#### Communication & Proactivity

At TIG and MN2S, I voluntarily created tutorials for future interns to learn more quickly on the job. At Makers Academy, I lead a retrospective for 25 people and received praise for creating engaging discussions. When planning the [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) project as a group, I encouraged non-judgmental discussions and democratic decision-making to promote strong teamwork. At Root Capital, I mentored a new colleague, providing clear and patient instructions.

#### Creating Solutions

I pitched two prototype ideas at Makers Academy - [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) - which were voted into becoming real projects by a cohort of 25 people. At The Angel Inn, I simplified taking reservations for the team by creating an easy-to-use form template and seating plan.

#### Self-learning

Before studying at Makers Academy, I taught myself HTML, CSS and WordPress to redesign websites for Louis Parkinson Climbing and [Man Overboard Quintet](https://manoverboardswing.co.uk). I also learnt the basics of Google analytics and social media analytics tools to track engagement for Louis Parkinson Climbing.

## Interests & Hobbies

I often attend coding meetups - previous groups include LRUG, LNUG, HackerNest and eXtreme Tuesday Club. I also enjoy performing and watching live music, and recording [film](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenRoss92/videos?live_view=500&sort=dd&view=0&flow=list)
 and [contemporary](https://soundcloud.com/ben-ross-92) music.
