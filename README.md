## Skills

#### Being Proactive

Whilst learning as a Technical Support Intern at TIG, I voluntarily kept categorised notes online to recall previous fixes quicker. My superiors praised this and requested to use them for training future interns. At MN2S, I voluntarily created clear and concise tutorials for future interns on altering the front-end code of the company website as well as WordPress and Photoshop tasks.

#### Learning Technical Skills

In order to redesign both the [Louis Parkinson Climbing](http://louisparkinsonclimbing.co.uk/) and [Man Overboard Quintet](http://manoverboardswing.co.uk/) websites, I taught myself HTML, CSS and improved my WordPress knowledge, as well as Google Analytics and social media analytics tools to market Louis Parkinson Climbing. At MN2S, I learnt WordPress and basic Photoshop quickly, researching anything unfamiliar and keeping notes to recall steps quickly and avoid repeating questions, as well as learning affiliate marketing programs at Stream:20.

#### Finding Solutions

As a Technical Support Intern at TIG, I researched and fixed customers’ bugs without having prior IT servicing experience or knowledge, but knowing where and how to look. When redesigning and fixing issues of the Louis Parkinson Climbing, MN2S and Man Overboard Quintet websites, I found and implemented solutions through researching and asking the right questions of the wider online community.

#### Creating Solutions

At Makers Academy, I pitched two minimum viable products ideas - [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) - which were voted for by my cohort of twenty-five people into becoming real projects. At The Angel Inn, my manager implemented my solution for managing reservations quicker and easier, involving a visual map and tally chart to track available seating.

#### Thinking Analytically

At JW3, I created a hot-desking plan to accommodate staff within limited space. I calculated the remaining desk time available by subtracting the total hours worked from the total available desk time. I then assigned working hours by viewing the daily total differences in a table. I also helped the CEO gain an overview of important staff and customer feedback by tallying, ranking and combining varying and unstructured answers into tables and graphs for concise reporting.

#### Communicating

As a volunteer at Noam, I lead activities and presentations for young adolescents with confidence and enthusiasm. I worked well in a team of twenty, exchanging feedback appropriately and engaging with over one hundred participants. At Makers Academy, I lead a retrospective for my cohort of twenty-five people and was praised by them and my teacher for leading the discussions and prompting engaging questions. I also mentored a junior student, providing clear explanations to help them learn. At The Angel Inn, I helped train new staff in a clear and patient manner.
