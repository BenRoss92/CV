I’m a full stack developer with a creative background in music. While teaching myself front-end development in my spare time, I developed a passion for coding and decided to pursue software development by studying full-stack development at Makers Academy, London's leading coding boot camp. Since then I have gained hands-on experience at companies with both small and large teams in a variety of technologies in new and older codebases.

## Skills

#### Communication

At YouView and Root Capital, I voluntarily mentored multiple new team members, pairing and giving support to help them learn quickly in a protected environment. At Makers Academy, I lead an in-person cross-team retrospective for 25 people, receiving praise for creating engaging discussions. When planning the [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) group project at Makers Academy, I encouraged open discussions and democratic decision-making, helping to promote strong teamwork. 

#### Creating Solutions

At YouView, I created and helped implement ideas for solving team Scrum and ways-of-working issues, which were praised by both the team's Agile Coach and manager. At Makers Academy I pitched two prototype ideas - [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) - which won the majority of votes from 25 students to become real group projects.

#### Self-learning

While at YouView, I have voluntarily taken online courses in Android (from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/devslopes-android-kotlin/)), [RxJS](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-rxjs) and [React](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Way3@NFNQVrQkIXn5IR27oH41jV5v4-UOU9xQYSWB7qRQ5Bu8oCzRwlTEyUCAziumq5jR/) to learn technologies on the job more quickly, and have created [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/BenRoss92) to show the results of practising these technologies.

## Interests & Hobbies

I sometimes attend coding meetups and workshops, recent examples being [DroidCon](https://www.droidcon.com/) 2022, [London Node.js User Group](https://www.meetup.com/london-nodejs), [Coders UK Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/codersuk/) and [zero2hero Training](https://www.meetup.com/zero2hero/). I also enjoy playing guitar in a music band and have performed at YouView company events.
