## Skills

#### Communication & Proactivity

At TIG and MN2S, I voluntarily created tutorials and notes which would help train future interns quicker. At Makers Academy, I lead a retrospective for a cohort of 25 people and was praised for being engaging, leading discussions and prompting important questions. I also mentored a junior student, providing clear and patient instruction. When planning [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) as a group, I encouraged open discussions and democratic decisions to promote strong teamwork.

#### Learning Technical Skills

In order to redesign both the [Louis Parkinson Climbing](http://louisparkinsonclimbing.co.uk/) and [Man Overboard Quintet](http://manoverboardswing.co.uk/) websites, I taught myself HTML, CSS and improved my WordPress knowledge, as well as Google Analytics and social media analytics tools to market Louis Parkinson Climbing. At MN2S, I learnt WordPress and basic Photoshop quickly, researching anything unfamiliar and keeping notes to recall steps quickly and avoid repeating questions, as well as learning affiliate marketing programs at Stream:20.

#### Researching & Solving Problems

As a Technical Support Intern, I researched and solved customers’ bugs without previous IT experience, deducing where and how to look. I pitched two prototype ideas at Makers Academy - [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) - subsequently voted by my cohort of twenty-five people into becoming real projects. At The Angel Inn, I improved the efficiency of managing reservations by providing a visual solution to management.

#### Analytical Thinking

At JW3, I created a hot-desking plan to accommodate staff within limited space. I calculated the remaining desk time available by subtracting the total hours worked from the total available desk time. I then assigned working hours by viewing the daily total differences in a table. I also helped the CEO gain an overview of important staff and customer feedback by tallying, ranking and combining varying and unstructured answers into tables and graphs for concise reporting.
