I’m a full stack developer with a creative background in music. While teaching myself front-end development in my spare time, I developed a passion for coding and decided to pursue software development by studying full-stack development at Makers Academy, London's leading coding boot camp. Since then I have gained hands-on experience at companies with both small and large teams in a variety of technologies in new and older codebases.

## Skills

#### Communication & Proactivity

At TIG and MN2S, I voluntarily created tutorials for future interns to learn more quickly on the job. At Makers Academy, I lead a retrospective for 25 people and received praise for creating engaging discussions. When planning the [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) project as a group, I encouraged non-judgmental discussions and democratic decision-making to promote strong teamwork. At Root Capital, I mentored a new colleague, providing clear and patient instructions.

#### Creating Solutions

I pitched two prototype ideas at Makers Academy - [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2) - which were voted into becoming real projects by a cohort of 25 people. At The Angel Inn, I simplified taking reservations for the team by creating an easy-to-use form template and seating plan.

#### Self-learning

Before studying at Makers Academy, I taught myself HTML, CSS and WordPress to redesign websites for Louis Parkinson Climbing and [Man Overboard Quintet](https://manoverboardswing.co.uk). I also learnt the basics of Google analytics and social media analytics tools to track engagement for Louis Parkinson Climbing.

## Interests & Hobbies

I sometimes attend coding meetups and workshops, recent examples being [DroidCon](https://www.droidcon.com/) 2022, [London Node.js User Group](https://www.meetup.com/london-nodejs), [Coders UK Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/codersuk/) and [zero2hero Training](https://www.meetup.com/zero2hero/). I also enjoy playing guitar in a music band and have performed at YouView company events.
