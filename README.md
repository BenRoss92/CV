I’m a full-stack developer with a background in music who has always had an interest in building abstract things. Having studied Music Technology at university and created friends' websites, I decided to combine my creative ability and technological interest by studying at Europe’s leading coding bootcamp, Makers Academy.

Having learnt music to a high standard has aided my ability to learn coding. In both subjects, I’ve used patterns and building blocks to achieve abstract goals. I’m used to patient, dedicated repetition, using best practices and switching from a detailed view to seeing a work as a whole. Having also switched between musical instruments as well as programming languages, I have practiced recognizing and transitioning between similar underlying concepts.

## Skills

#### Being Proactive

Whilst learning as a Technical Support Intern at TIG, I voluntarily kept categorised notes online to recall previous fixes quicker. My superiors praised this and requested to use them for training future interns. At MN2S, I voluntarily created clear and concise tutorials for future interns on altering the front-end code of the company website as well as WordPress and Photoshop tasks.

#### Learning Technical Skills

In order to redesign both the [Louis Parkinson Climbing](http://louisparkinsonclimbing.co.uk/) and [Man Overboard Quintet](http://manoverboardswing.co.uk/) websites, I taught myself HTML, CSS and improved my WordPress knowledge, as well as Google Analytics and social media analytics tools to market Louis Parkinson Climbing. At MN2S, I learnt WordPress and basic Photoshop quickly, researching anything unfamiliar and keeping notes to recall steps quickly and avoid repeating questions, as well as learning affiliate marketing programs at Stream:20.

#### Finding Solutions

As a Technical Support Intern at TIG, I researched and fixed customers’ bugs without having prior IT servicing experience or knowledge, but knowing where and how to look. When redesigning and fixing issues of the Louis Parkinson Climbing, MN2S and Man Overboard Quintet websites, I found and implemented solutions through researching and asking the right questions of the wider online community.

#### Creating Solutions

In meetings at The Angel Inn, I put forward solutions to help our team overcome logistical problems, for example not knowing available seating numbers when moving chairs and tables around for abnormal sized parties. The manager put my idea into place – a visual map of tables, respective seating numbers including a tally of unused chairs for each table and as a total – saving us valuable time and improving service when taking reservations during busy periods.

During the Makers Academy course, when two opportunities arose to pitch and work on our own ideas in teams, my ideas were voted as favourites for both projects by others – [Atomodoro](https://github.com/BenRoss92/Atomodoro) and [Plyr2](https://github.com/BenRoss92/plyr2). I also decided upon and implemented the user experience for Louis Parkinson Climbing as well as ideas for its blog and social media channels.

#### Analytical Thinking

At JW3, I summarised feedback from a team-building week for the CEO and external consultants. Staff had given their concerns before their two companies had merged. I highlighted important information in a concise and easy-to-read manner, creating tables and graphs to tally, rank and combine information to display the most common and pressing issues.

I also helped write a staff-seating plan to accommodate the merging of staff into one building with limited office space. I created a tally of all staff’s working hours to map out a hot-desking solution whilst keeping departments seated together, and adapted this plan as often part-time workers’ schedules would change.

#### Communication

In a team of 20 volunteers, for Noam, I helped care for over 100 thirteen year-olds full-time for 3 weeks in a team of 20, requiring, good public speaking, confidence, enthusiasm and empathy. I lead and helped run presentations, activities and workshops and exchanged feedback with team members and participants to improve the planning and running of sessions.

I helped train new staff in a clear and easy-to-follow manner at The Angel Inn and at Makers Academy, engaged and diffused customer feedback at TIG and was praised by pairing partners and group members at Makers Academy as being honest and easy to work with. I also mentored a junior 6 weeks behind me on the course in order to help guide their learning and coding practices.
